# UPER

## Understand, Plan, Execute  , Reflect


### To Understand
# Re-phrase the problem.
# Make sure to fully grasp what is being asked
# If you understand what success looks like, you understand the problem


### To Plan
# Gather info nonstop
# get rid of repeat info 

### Execute
# Execute the plan!

### Reflect on the results of the execution









# Code a factorial function
# First recursively, then iteratively

#U
## definition of factorial
### Multiplication of all numbers beginning at the given number down to 1
### 5!
### 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1



# P
## Plan for recursive



# E

# def recursive_factorial(n):
#     if n < 2:
#         return 1

#     return n * recursive_factorial(n - 1)


# # R
# ## Negative numbers
# ### Space and time complexity?
# ### Space and time complexity are linear

# def iterative_factorial(n):
#     multi = 1
#     for i in range(n):
#         multi = multi * i
#     return multi
